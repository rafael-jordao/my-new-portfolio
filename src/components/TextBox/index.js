                Hi there! I'm a brazilian-based Graphic Designer currently studying to become a Front-end Developer.
                <br /> <br />
                I mainly work with HTML, CSS and  JavaScript, but I'm also experimenting with NodeJS, ReactJS and some C# language at the moment. My interest in technology led me to my new major - Systems Analysis and Development at PUC MINAS <span>(Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais).</span> 
            </p>
        </TextBoxx>

    )
}

export default TextBox;
